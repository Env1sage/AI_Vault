    """The Recommendation Engine (Handbook's Founder Command Center &
    Recommendation Engine, Phase 7) — organization-scoped, unlike every
    prior job (`ScanJob`/`EnrichmentJob`/`EmbeddingJob`) which is per-
    connector, since recommendations and the dashboard reason about an
    org's storage as a whole. Runs entirely over already-stored data (no
    external API calls, no per-file I/O) — a single deterministic pass:
    pull the org's data once, evaluate every rule and insight generator
    against it, persist the results, and record one `DashboardSnapshot`.

    100% deterministic in this phase, no `AIGateway` calls — Phase 6's
    completion provider is still a stub (per the founder's explicit
    choice), so there is no real reasoning capability to invoke yet.
    `RecommendationRule`/`InsightGenerator` are still generic Protocols a
    future AI-reasoning-based rule could implement without a redesign —
    see ADR-019."""
