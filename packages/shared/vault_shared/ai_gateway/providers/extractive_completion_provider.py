    """The AI Gateway's default completion adapter when no real LLM
    provider is configured — never invents an answer. It assembles a
    response directly from the retrieved context `ContextBuilderService`
    already ranked and deduplicated, clearly labeled (`provider`, in every
    persisted `ConversationMessage`) so it's never mistaken for actual LLM
    reasoning.

    This *is* the Handbook's "prefer deterministic retrieval, only invoke
    an LLM when reasoning is required" principle taken to its logical
    conclusion: reasoning genuinely requires a real provider, and none is
    configured yet (Phase 6 was built with the completion side stubbed —
    see ADR-018). Swapping this for a real provider (Claude, GPT, Gemini)
    is a new adapter class plus a factory change in `get_ai_gateway()`;
    nothing that calls `AIGateway.complete()` changes."""
