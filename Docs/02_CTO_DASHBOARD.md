# 02 — CTO Dashboard

Status: **Living document — update every sprint, at the "Documentation updated" step of the lifecycle in [`00_ENGINEERING_HANDBOOK.md`](00_ENGINEERING_HANDBOOK.md) §4.** This is the executive status page: read this first to know where the project actually stands.

Last updated: 2026-08-04 (Phase 10 implementation pass — Production Hardening, Enterprise Readiness & V1 Release. Security/observability/backup-DR work verified for real against local Postgres/Redis and a real Celery worker; Terraform and Docker infrastructure validated statically (no cloud account or Docker daemon available in this environment) rather than applied/run live — see ADR-022 and the Phase 10 Release Readiness Report for the exact boundary of what was and wasn't live-verified.)

## Sprint

**Sprint 10 — Phase 10: Production Hardening, Enterprise Readiness & V1 Release**

## Current Phase

**Phase 10 — Production Hardening, Enterprise Readiness & V1 Release** (see [`01_PROJECT_MASTER.md`](01_PROJECT_MASTER.md) §4 for the full roadmap)

## Completion Percentage

**Overall: all 10 phases implemented, pending founder manual test & CTO review · Version 1.0 candidate**

| Phase | Status | % Complete |
|---|---|---|
| 0 — Engineering Blueprint | ✅ Complete | 100% |
| 1 — Foundation | 🟡 Implemented — awaiting founder test & CTO review | ~90% |
| 2 — Auth | 🟡 Implemented — awaiting founder test & CTO review | ~90% |
| 3 — Storage Scanner (Connector Platform) | 🟡 Implemented — awaiting founder test & CTO review | ~90% |
| 4 — Storage Discovery & Scanner Engine | 🟡 Implemented — awaiting founder test & CTO review | ~90% |
| 5 — Metadata Intelligence & Knowledge Engine | 🟡 Implemented — awaiting founder test & CTO review | ~85% |
| 6 — AI Intelligence Engine & Semantic Search | 🟡 Implemented — awaiting founder test & CTO review | ~80% |
| 7 — Founder Command Center & Recommendation Engine | 🟡 Implemented — awaiting founder test & CTO review | ~80% |
| 8 — Execution Engine & Human Approval System | 🟡 Implemented — awaiting founder test & CTO review | ~75% |
| 9 — Automation Engine & Workflow Platform | 🟡 Implemented — awaiting founder test & CTO review | ~70% |
| 10 — Production Hardening, Security & Enterprise Release | 🟡 Implemented — validated, not live-deployed | ~80% |

**Why Phase 10 isn't higher despite being "implemented":** the gap is entirely "no Docker daemon, no cloud account existed in this development environment" — everything static-verifiable (code, config syntax, unit/integration tests, Terraform's own validator) passed cleanly; nothing here reflects an unresolved code or design problem. See the Release Readiness Report's §5/§9.

## Track Progress

| Track | Progress | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Backend | Phase 10 hardening applied | Security headers middleware, tightened CORS, 7 more endpoint families rate-limited, Prometheus `/metrics` + OTel/Sentry instrumentation, dashboard response caching (Redis, 30s TTL, live-verified), graceful shutdown (`lifespan` disposes DB pool + Redis client). No new product endpoints — 78 `/v1` endpoints total, unchanged in count from Phase 9. |
| Frontend | No product changes | Lint/typecheck/test/build all reverified clean; one transitive dev-dependency CVE fixed (`brace-expansion`, via `pnpm-workspace.yaml` override); bundle size reviewed (route-code-split already, 251.9 kB/79.2 kB gzip main chunk — no action needed). |
| Worker | Phase 10 hardening applied | Metrics/tracing/Sentry instrumentation, correlation-ID extraction (`worker/observability.py` — live-verified against a real running Celery worker), a dedicated `metrics_server.py` sidecar for Prometheus multiprocess exposition. No new task types. |
| AI | Newly instrumented, not newly capable | `AIGateway.embed()`/`.complete()` now record `vault_ai_provider_latency_seconds` at the boundary itself — the completion provider itself is still the Phase 6 stub, unchanged. |
| Storage Scanner / Knowledge Engine / AI Intelligence Engine / Recommendation Engine / Execution Engine / Automation Engine | Unchanged product logic | Phase 10 touched none of these apps' business logic — only cross-cutting hardening layered on top. |
| Google Workspace | Unchanged | No new Drive API surface. |
| Security | Substantially hardened this phase | See the new [Security Guide](08_SECURITY_GUIDE.md) in full — response headers, rate-limit expansion, 2 real dependency CVEs found and fixed (`cryptography`, `pypdf`) plus 1 transitive frontend CVE, `gitleaks` secret scanning now in CI, Trivy image scanning now in CI, a documented threat model. |
| Testing | 609 tests total, all green | Backend/shared 352, worker/shared 168, frontend 89 — plus `terraform validate` (8 modules + 2 environments, zero errors) and `docker compose config` (base + monitoring overlay, real merge behavior verified) as new Phase 10 validation layers beyond pytest/vitest. |
| Infrastructure | Reference implementation complete, unapplied | Terraform (network/database/redis/storage/secrets/compute/load_balancer/monitoring modules × staging/production environments) — written and validated, never applied against a real AWS account. Docker images hardened (non-root users) — config-validated, never built (no Docker daemon in this environment). Optional local Prometheus/Grafana stack (`docker-compose.monitoring.yml`) — config-validated, never run. |
| CI/CD | Completed | New `security` job (pip-audit ×2, pnpm audit, gitleaks), Trivy image scanning added to `docker-build`, new `deploy`/`rollback` jobs (manual-dispatch + GitHub-Environment-approval gated — safe by construction since no deploy secrets exist yet in this repo). |
| Documentation | Full required set complete | 11 new documents (`04`-`15`) + ADR-022 + this dashboard + Project Master + all 4 READMEs + the Release Readiness Report. See `Docs/phases/PHASE_10_COMPLETION_REPORT.md` §7 for the full checklist. |

## Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Terraform has never been applied against a real AWS account | The first real `terraform apply` is genuinely untested, despite passing static validation | `terraform fmt`/`validate` clean with zero errors across every module and both environments; a real circular-dependency bug was already found and fixed by this process (ADR-022) — the founder's first `plan`/`apply` should still be treated as a first real test, run against a disposable/staging account first |
| Docker images and the monitoring stack have never actually been built/run in this development environment | Same category of gap as Terraform — config is correct per every static check available, but unexercised | `docker compose config` (merge behavior) was verified for both the base stack and the monitoring overlay; CI's `docker-build` job does build and Trivy-scan all three images on every PR going forward, so the first real verification happens automatically the next time CI runs in an environment with a Docker daemon |
| Worker Prometheus metrics require `PROMETHEUS_MULTIPROC_DIR` to be correctly shared across every worker replica in production | Metrics could silently under-report if a real multi-replica deployment doesn't wire this correctly | Documented explicitly in the [Monitoring Guide](11_MONITORING_GUIDE.md) §4 as a "verify before relying on this" checklist item, not left implicit |
| No load/concurrent-user testing performed | Real production performance under load is unverified | No deployable environment existed to test against; flagged as a pre-launch task in the Release Readiness Report §9 |
| No automated (scheduled) production backup job | The drilled backup/restore scripts work, but nothing invokes `backup.sh` on a cron yet in production | Documented as a known limitation ([DR Guide](10_DISASTER_RECOVERY_GUIDE.md) §8) — a natural first Phase 11 item |
| Every Phase 1-9 risk not closed by Phase 10 remains open | Same risks logged in each phase's own history | See each phase's completion report; Phase 10 hardened the platform around these, it did not resolve phase-specific product gaps (e.g., only 3/11 recommendation rules have an executable action, only 4/7 automation event triggers are wired) |

## Blockers

None currently. Phase 10 is implemented and validated as strongly as this development environment allows — see the [Release Readiness Report](phases/PHASE_10_COMPLETION_REPORT.md) for the precise boundary between "live-verified" (backup/restore drill, dashboard caching, correlation IDs, rate limiting, security headers — all confirmed against real running Postgres/Redis/Celery) and "statically validated only" (Terraform, Docker images, the monitoring stack — no cloud account or Docker daemon available here). The founder's own first `terraform apply` and first `docker compose up` with a running daemon are the natural next real-world checkpoints.

## Next Sprint

**Sprint 11.** Scope to be provided by the founder — the CTO's own closing note in `PHASE_10.md` recommends a "Version 1.0 Documentation Freeze" (treat the Handbook, ADR log, phase documents, API standards, and coding standards as a frozen, version-controlled release artifact from this point forward) before any further phase work begins. Candidate next-sprint items, per this phase's own Known Issues list: a real LLM completion provider, real email delivery, closing the recommendation-rule/execution-action coverage gap, wiring the remaining 3 automation event triggers, load testing, and the founder's first real cloud deployment.

## Technical Debt

- **Stack revision (ADR-012), phase-numbering mismatch (Phases 1-8), manual `packages/types` sync, no unit tests on frontend route components, no real Google OAuth Client ID/Secret in CI** — all unchanged, carried forward from prior phases' dashboards (see each phase's own completion report for detail).
- **`WorkflowPolicy` conditions are recommendation-level, not per-file** (ADR-021) — unchanged.
- **Only 4/7 automation event trigger types are wired to a real firing hook** (ADR-021) — unchanged.
- **Only 3/11 recommendation rules have a matching executable action** (ADR-020) — unchanged.
- **Email notifications remain fully stubbed** (ADR-021) — unchanged.
- **No real LLM completion provider** (ADR-018) — unchanged.
- **New this phase — Terraform/Docker/monitoring-stack "validated, not applied" gap** — see Risks above. Closes the moment a founder runs these against a real account/daemon; the code itself is not the open item.
- **New this phase — no database-role-level `REVOKE` on audit tables** (currently enforced only by application code never exposing update/delete) — documented in the [Security Guide](08_SECURITY_GUIDE.md) §12 as a real, if low-severity, gap.
- **New this phase — no autoscaling policy for ECS services**, manual `desired_count` only — a natural Phase 11 item once real traffic patterns exist to size against.
- **New this phase — no automated (cron) production backup job** — the script exists and is drilled; nothing schedules it yet.
- **New this phase — no Grafana-native alerting rules on the application-layer metrics** — only CloudWatch infrastructure-layer alarms page today; the dashboards exist but nothing pages off Prometheus data directly yet.

### How to update this dashboard

At the end of every sprint (Engineering Handbook §4): update Sprint, Current Phase, Completion Percentage, and Track Progress against what actually merged to `develop`; add/resolve Risks and Blockers based on what surfaced; set Next Sprint to the upcoming phase; log any shortcuts taken as Technical Debt with enough detail to act on later, not just "TODO: fix this."
